				Truth or dare is a fun game to play with your friends, especially at sleepovers and during other times when you probably wonâ€™t be disturbed by siblings, parents, or pets. While things might get weird and sometimes uncomfortable, truth or dare is often really funny as well.
<br><br>
				Truth or dare? is a mostly verbal party game requiring two or more players. Players are given the choice between answering a question truthfully, or performing a "dare", both of which are set by the other players.
<br><br>
				Players must performing the dare they are given, or truthfully answer the question asked. Players are not permitted to change their mind about choosing "truth" or "dare". otherways there is a punishment! ^_^
